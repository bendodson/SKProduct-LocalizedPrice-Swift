SKProduct-LocalizedPrice-Swift
==============================

A Swift extension to add localizedPrice() to SKProduct.

To use, add the SKProduct-LocalizedPrice.swift file to your project. You can now use product.localizedPrice() (assuming 'product' is an SKProduct object) to get a String with the price localized to the device (so in the US it might say "$0.99" whereas in the UK it might say "Â£0.69")
